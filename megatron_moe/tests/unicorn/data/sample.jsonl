{"text": "Major League Baseball All-Century Team\n\nIn 1999, the Major League Baseball All-Century Team was chosen by popular vote of fans. To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest Major League Baseball players from the past century. Over two million fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.\n\nThe top two vote-getters from each position, except outfielders (nine), and the top six pitchers were placed on the team. A select panel then added five legends to create a thirty-man team:\u2014Warren Spahn (who finished #10 among pitchers), Christy Mathewson (#14 among pitchers), Lefty Grove (#18 among pitchers), Honus Wagner (#4 among shortstops), and Stan Musial (#11 among outfielders).\n\nThe nominees for the All-Century team were presented at the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Preceding Game 2 of the 1999 World Series, the members of the All-Century Team were revealed. Every living player named to the team attended.\n\nFor the complete list of the 100 players nominated, see The MLB All-Century Team.\n\nSelected players\n\nPete Rose controversy\nThere was controversy over the inclusion in the All-Century Team of Pete Rose, who had been banned from baseball for life 10 years earlier. Some questioned Rose's presence on a team officially endorsed by Major League Baseball, but fans at the stadium gave him a standing ovation. During the on-field ceremony, which was emceed by Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, NBC Sports' Jim Gray questioned Rose about his refusal to admit to gambling on baseball.  Gray's interview became controversial, with some arguing that it was good journalism, while others objected that the occasion was an inappropriate setting for Gray's persistence.  After initially refusing to do so, Gray apologized a few days later.  On January 8, 2004, more than four years later, Rose admitted publicly to betting on baseball games in his autobiography My Prison Without Bars.\n\nSee also\nMajor League Baseball All-Time Team, a similar team chosen by the Baseball Writers' Association of America in \nLatino Legends Team\nDHL Hometown Heroes (2006): the most outstanding player in the history of each MLB franchise, based on on-field performance, leadership quality and character value\n\nList of MLB awards\nTeam of the century\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAll-Century Team Vote Totals from ESPN.com\nAll-Century Team DVD from Amazon.com\nAll-Century Team Information from Baseball Almanac\n\nCategory:1999 Major League Baseball season\nCategory:Major League Baseball trophies and awards\nCategory:History of Major League Baseball\nCategory:Awards established in 1999", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

The highly controversial \u201cconvention center project,\u201d as it was known to those in Lancaster County (pop. 510,000), was originally proposed in 1999 as a $75 million \u201cpublic-private\u201d partnership. The project included a publicly-owned convention center ($30 million) and a privately-owned hotel ($45 million).

Its opponents, however, feel it poses an unacceptable risk to taxpayers.\nThe hotel portion of the project is owned 50% by Lancaster Newspapers, Inc. which have been accused of using their monopoly print position in the County to promote the project and stifle opposition.

{"text": "Mai-Mai\n\nThe term Mayi-Mayi or Mai-Mai refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of Rwandan forces and Rwanda-affiliated Congolese rebel groups, but some may have formed to exploit the war for their own advantage by looting, cattle rustling or banditry.\n\nGroups that fall under the umbrella term \"Mai-Mai\" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated resistance fighters. Because Mai Mai have had only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.\n\nMai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, North Kivu and South Kivu (the \"Kivus\"), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied Banyamulenge-dominated rebel faction, the Rally for Congolese Democracy\u2013Goma (RCD-Goma) during the Second Congo War. While militias have long been common in the Kivus, particularly among the minority Batembo and Babembe ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai-Mai. Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 Lusaka Accord meant to end the Second Congo War, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict and the lack of cooperation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process.\n\nMai-Mai in North and South Kivu\n\nAccording to a 2001 UN report, 20,000 to 30,000 Mai-Mai were active in the two Kivu provinces. The two most powerful and well-organized Mai-Mai groups in the Kivus were led by Generals Padiri and Dunia. Currently most active is a group which is called Mai-Mai Yakutumba, was organized in 2007 by General Yakutumba. They were reported to have received aid from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and are widely viewed by other Mai Mai groups as the leaders, though not the commanders, of the Kivu Mai-Mai. A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the Mudundu 40/Front de R\u00e9sistance et de D\u00e9fense du Kivu (FRDKI) and Mouvement de Lutte contre l'Agression au Za\u00efre/Forces Unies de R\u00e9sistance Nationale contre l'Agression de la R\u00e9publ\u00edque D\u00e9mocratique du Congo (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the Rwandan military and Rally for Congolese Democracy\u2013Goma (RCD-Goma).\n\nWalikale and Masisi north of Goma were the centres of Mai-Mai activity in North Kivu.  In South Kivu, there have historically been concentrations around Walungu and Bunyakiri south of Lake Kivu, around Uvira and Mwenaga at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, further south around Fizi, and around Shabunda, between the Rwandan border and Kindu.\n\nA Mai-Mai leader, Colonel Mayele, was arrested by UN forces in October 2010, allegedly being the leader behind mass rapes in the Walikale region of North Kivu province.\n\nMai-Mai in Katanga\n\nA former leader of the Mai-Mai, G\u00e9d\u00e9on Kyungu Mutanga, turned himself over to MONUC troops in May 2006. He was found guilty of numerous war crimes between October 2003 and May 2006 and was sentenced to death by the Kipushi Military Tribunal in Katanga Province on 6 March 2009. He escaped from prison in September 2011 and formed the Mai-Mai Kata Katanga (\"Secede Katanga\").\n\nOther Mai-Mai groups\n\nThere was a large Mai-Mai presence in Maniema, in particular around Kindu and Kalemie.  Province Orientale also hosts a number of Mai-Mai, but these groups were apparently involved in long-standing ethnic disputes.\n\nMai-Mai Gedeon is also commanded by Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga and loosely tied to his Mai-Mai Kata Katanga. The Corak Kata Katanga also known as the Co-ordination for a Referendum on Self-determination for Katanga, composed mainly of former Katanga Tigers, a separatist group active in the 1960s. They claim to be behind the attack on the Katanga airport in February 2011. It is unclear to what extent all these groups are co-ordinated.\n\nThe Nduma Defense of Congo (or Mai-Mai Sheka) was formed in 2009 by former minerals trader Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka, an ethnic Nyanga. Sheka claims the group was formed to liberate the mines of Walikale Territory in North Kivu. The NDC are accused of a mass rape of at least 387 women, men, and children over a three day span in Walikale in 2010.\n\nMai-Mai and the mountain gorillas\n\nIn May 2007, Mai-Mai killed two wildlife officers in Virunga National Park and threatened to kill mountain gorillas if the government retaliated. The Mai-Mai are also suspected of the killings of nine mountain gorillas, with the use of machetes, and automatic weapons. In an October 2012 incident, Mai-Mai killed two park staff and a soldier, while three soldiers were injured. From 1990 to 2018 some 170 Virunga Rangers have died in such attacks, according to the World Wildlife Foundation. \n\nSix Virunga Park Rangers were reported to have been killed in Virunga National Park. Five rangers and a driver were killed in an ambush and a sixth ranger was injured in the Central section of the vast reserve on April 9, 2018. Officials suspected the attacks were by the Mai-Mai.\n\nSee also\nResistance Patriots Ma\u00ef-Ma\u00ef\nMai-Mai Kata Katanga\nG\u00e9d\u00e9on Kyungu Mutanga\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nGlobal Security description\nUN Assessment of armed groups in Congo, 1 April 2002\nNational Geographic\nMai-mai atrocities included canibalism\n\nCategory:Factions of the Second Congo War\nCategory:History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nCategory:History of Rwanda\nCategory:Rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nCategory:Rebel groups that actively control territory\nCategory:Vigilantism", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

{"text": "Neighbors (novel)\n\nNeighbors is a 1980 novel by American author Thomas Berger. It is a satire of manners and suburbia, and a comment on emotional alienation with echoes of the works of Franz Kafka. Earl Keese\u2019s character and situation begin realistically but become increasingly fantastic. Keese is an Everyman whose life is swiftly turned upside down. As he scrambles to reclaim his sense of normalcy and dignity, he comes to think that everyone, including his family, is against him.\n\nPlot summary \n\nEarl Keese is a middle-aged, middle-class suburbanite with a wife, Enid, and teenage daughter, Elaine. Earl is content with his dull, unexceptional life, but this changes when a younger, less sophisticated couple, Harry and Ramona, move in next door. Harry is physically intimidating and vulgar; Ramona is sexually aggressive, and both impose themselves on the Keese household. Their free-spirited personalities and overbearing and boorish behavior endear them to Enid and Elaine, but Earl fears that he is losing control of his life and his family. Over the course of one night, the antagonism between Earl and his new neighbors escalates into suburban warfare.\n\nAnalysis \nBerger's off-kilter tone blurs the line between paranoia and reality, defense and offense, action and intention, ally and adversary. Harry and Ramona seem to constantly undergo changes in their respective personalities and Enid and Elaine appear to choose sides against Earl at random, but Berger also implies that it is Earl\u2019s sense of reality that is skewed and deluded.\n\nEarl is frustrated because he can never prove that Harry and Ramona are doing anything wrong on purpose, and the more he attempts to expose them, the more ridiculous he makes himself. Yet Earl comes to realize that Harry and Ramona have served as the crucible of his redemption: being forced out of his comfort zone of complacency and habit has provided him with an excitement he has never known before. As Earl comes to recognize value in his neighbors, he realizes that his wife is a distrustful alcoholic, his daughter is an underachiever and petty thief, and that his new neighbors can provide him with an escape from his existence of insignificance and emotional impotence. From a nightmare comes hope and a strengthened resolve to survive. In his study of Berger, writer Stanley Trachtenberg describes Neighbors as an existentialist parable in which \"the loss of coherence between various aspects of self comically fragments the notion of identity and thus fictionalizes the existential concept of authenticity as a shaping condition of it.\" \n\nIn a 1980 newspaper interview, Berger said of Neighbors, \"As my 10th novel, begun at the close of my 20th year as a published novelist, it is appropriately a bizarre celebration of whatever gift I have, the strangest of all my narratives . . . the morality of this work, like that of all my other volumes, will be in doubt until the end of the narrative \u2013 and perhaps to the end of eternity, now that I think about it.\"\n\nCharacters \nEarl Keese\nEnid Keese\nElaine Keese\nHarry\nRamona\n\nAdaptations \nA film version was released in 1981, starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. It was also adapted into a play by Eve Summer, which premiered in Worcester, Massachusetts in 2007.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nNPR.org | Tom Perrotta Hails Suburban Sendup 'Neighbors'\n\nCategory:1980 American novels\nCategory:American novels adapted into films\nCategory:American novels adapted into plays\nCategory:Novels by Thomas Berger (novelist)", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

{"text": "Brown Man of the Muirs\n\nIn the folklore of the Anglo-Scottish border the Brown Man of the Muirs is a dwarf who serves as a guardian spirit of wild animals.\n\nFolklore\nWilliam Henderson provides an account of the Brown Man and a pair of hunters in Folklore of the Northern Counties (1879), taken from a letter sent by the historian Robert Surtees to Sir Walter Scott:\n\nIn the year before the Great Rebellion two young men from Newcastle were sporting on the high moors above Elsdon, and at last sat down to refresh themselves in a green glen near a mountain stream. The younger lad went to drink at the brook, and raising his head again saw the \"Brown man of the Muirs\", a dwarf very strong and stoutly built, his dress brown like withered bracken, his head covered with\nfrizzled red hair, his countenance ferocious, and his eyes glowing like those of a bull. After some parley, in which the stranger reproved the hunter for trespassing on his demesnes and slaying the creatures who were his subjects, and informed him how he himself lived only on whortleberries, nuts, and apples, he invited him home. The youth was on the point of accepting the invitation and springing\nacross the brook, when he was arrested by the voice of his companion, who thought he had tarried long, and looking round again \"the wee brown man was fled.\" It was thought that had the young man crossed the water the dwarf would have torn him to pieces. As it was he died within the year, in consequence, it was supposed, of his slighting the dwarf's admonition, and continuing his sport on the way home.Taylor, George and Raine, James (1852). A Memoir of Robert Surtees. Durham: George Andrews. pp. 81\u20132.\n\nWalter Scott in a return letter to Surtees suggested that the Brown Man may be related to the duergar (dwarfs) of Northumberland.\n\nFairy tales\nIn folklore the Brown Man appears as a solitary fairy, but in fairy tale literature he is a member of a tribe of similar beings. They once lived all over England and Scotland, but in the wake of human progress they dwindled in number and now live in a cave in Cumberland. Known as the Brown Men of the Moors and Mountains, they have great strength that allows them to hurl small boulders. By day they mine the mountains for gold and diamonds, and by night they feast in their underground hall or dance on the moors. They kidnap human children and kill any man they catch alone in the wilderness. However, they can be made subservient by repeating the incantation, \"Munko tiggle snobart tolwol dixy crambo\".\n\nSee also\nBrownie (folklore)\nRedcap\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Dwarves (mythology)\nCategory:English folklore\nCategory:Scottish folklore", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

{"text": "Frederick Lohden\n\nFrederick Charles Lohden OBE (13 June 1871 \u2013 13 April 1954) was an English sportsman who played rugby union as a forward at international level for England in a single game during the 1893 Home Nations Championship. After retiring from playing sport he became a sports administrator, most notably as the chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association.\n\nPersonal history\nLohden was born in Hartlepool in the north of England on 13 June 1871 to Jacob and Mary Lohden, and christened at Christ Church, Hartlepool on 12 July of that year. He attended Durham School as a youth, completing his education in France and Germany. In 1898 he was married to Margaret Emily Marshall of Broadwater, Sussex.\n\nWith the outbreak of the First World War, Lohden, who already had military experience, was promoted to Lieutenant in the 4th Durham Volunteer Artillery. He later joined the East Surrey Regiment. In 1917 he was transferred to the Ministry of Shipping and was placed in charge of Standard Steamers, Russian Steamers and Oilers. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours for his work for the Ministry of Shipping. He later moved to Cheam on the border between London and Surrey where he worked as a shipping broker. Lohden later became the mayor of Sutton and Cheam, and was also made a Justice of the Peace.\n\nSporting history\nLohden showed promise as a sportsman while a youth, making the Durham School rugby XV while still a 15-year-old, the biggest forward in his team. On his return from education in mainland Europe he joined Hartlepool Rovers, and by the age of 19 he was selected to play at county level for Durham. By the 1892/93 season he was playing for one of England's premier clubs, Blackheath. While representing Blackheath he came to the attention of the English selectors and was chosen for the South of England team in the trials of the England squad. He was given his first and only cap in the opening game of the 1893 Home Nations Championship against Wales at the Cardiff Arms Park. The game started well for the English side, opening a 7\u20130 lead in the first half, one of the two tries scored by Lohden. A further England try at the start of the second half appeared to give England an overwhelming lead only to see an historic Welsh comeback, led by their talismanic captain Arthur Gould, which snatched victory from England in the final minutes. Although Lohden never played for England again, a series of minor injuries ending his career by 1896, he was selected for invitational tourists the Barbarians in 1893, and also represented Surrey county. After retiring from playing he kept up his connection with the sport of rugby by being elected onto the Durham County Rugby Union committee, serving them from 1896 to 1902.\n\nAs well as rugby, Lohden was a keen sports shooter, and won the Baltic Exchange 'miniature' Championship for three years running. On returning to civilian life after the war, Lohden became increasingly active in the world of racket sports. A skillful badminton player he represented Surrey County playing in four consecutive London Badminton doubles finals in 1920. This was followed by the title of Veteran's Doubles Champion of England in 1921. That year Lohden also set up the Surrey Badminton Association, becoming their first honorary secretary.\n\nIn 1907 Lohden put his sporting administrative abilities to further use when he was elected to the Surrey branch of the Lawn Tennis Association. He progressed to becoming the organisations chairman, and then in 1911 he joined the Council of the LTA. In 1933 he became chairman of the LTA and the year later its vice-president.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n \n\nCategory:1871 births\nCategory:1954 deaths\nCategory:Rugby union forwards\nCategory:English rugby union players\nCategory:England international rugby union players\nCategory:Barbarian F.C. players\nCategory:Blackheath F.C. players\nCategory:Sportspeople from Hartlepool\nCategory:Officers of the Order of the British Empire\nCategory:People educated at Durham School\nCategory:British Army personnel of World War I\nCategory:East Surrey Regiment officers\nCategory:Tennis in the United Kingdom", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}
{"text": "Association of Chief Police Officers\n\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), officially The Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was a not-for-profit private limited company that for many years led the development of policing practices in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Established in 1948, ACPO provided a forum for chief police officers to share ideas and coordinate their strategic operational responses, and advised government in matters such as terrorist attacks and civil emergencies. ACPO coordinated national police operations, major investigations, cross-border policing, and joint law enforcement. ACPO designated Senior Investigative Officers for major investigations and appointed officers to head ACPO units specialising in various areas of policing and crime reduction.\n\nACPO was led by Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde, QPM, who was, until 2009, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  He was elected as president by fellow members of ACPO in April 2009.\n\nACPO was funded by Home Office grants, profits from commercial activities and contributions from the 44 police authorities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nFollowing the Parker Review into ACPO, it was replaced in 2015 by a new body, the National Police Chiefs' Council, set up under a police collaboration agreement under Section 22A of the Police Act 1996.\n\nBackground\n\nUK policing sprang from local communities in the 1800s. Since the origins of policing, chief officers have regularly associated to discuss and share policing issues. Although ACPO as now recognised was formed in 1948, records of prior bodies go back to the early 1900s. The UK retains a decentralised model of policing based around the settlement which emerged from the Royal Commission on the work of the Police in 1962.\n\nACPO continued to provide a forum for chief officers across 44 local police forces and 13 national areas across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and provided local forces with agreed national policies and guidelines.\n\nACPO failed to convince its sponsors to contribute to its survival and in May 2011 the BBC reported that ACPO would run out of money in February 2012 without extra funding. ACPO was half-funded by the Home Office and half by 44 police authorities. A third of police authorities refused to pay in 2010 and another third were undecided. The Association of Police Authorities said the withdrawal of funding by police authorities was \"partly due to a squeeze on their income\". ACPO was due to wind up formally in April 2015.\n\nConstitutional status\n\nOver time, demands for coordination across the police service increased as society changed, for example to take account of new developments in international terrorism and organised crime, or roles such as monitoring offenders on release from prison or working with young people to divert them from crime.\n\nIn 1997 ACPO was incorporated as a private company limited by guarantee. As a private company, ACPO was not subject to freedom of information legislation. It was not a staff association; the staff association for senior police officers was a separate body, the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA).\n\nThe change in structure from a \"band of volunteers\" to a limited company allowed the organisation to employ staff, enter into contracts for accommodation and publish accounts.\n\nA number of options were considered for the status of ACPO, including charitable status, but all were discounted.\n\nChief Constables and Commissioners are responsible for the direction and control of policing in their force areas. Although a national body and recognized by the government for consultation, ACPO had no powers of its own, nor any mandate to instruct chief officers.  However, the organisation allowed chief officers to form a national policy rather than replicate the work in each of their forces. For example, after the 1980\u201381 riots in 27 British cities including in St. Pauls and Brixton ACPO began to prepare the Public Order Manual of Tactical Operations and Related Matters.  Police forces began training in its tactics late in 1983.\n\nMembership\nACPO was not a staff association. It acted for the police service, not its members. The separate Chief Police Officers Staff Association acts for chief officers.\n\nACPO was composed of the chief police officers of the 44 police forces in England & Wales and Northern Ireland, the Deputy Chief Constable and Assistant Chief Constable of 42 of those forces and the Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Assistant Commissioner and Commanders of the remaining two - the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. Certain senior non-police staff and senior members of national police agencies and certain other specialised and non-geographical forces in the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands were also members.\n\nAs of March 2010 there were 349 members of ACPO. The membership elected a full-time President, who held the office of Chief Constable under the Police Reform Act 2002.\n\nACPO bodies\nACPO was responsible for several ancillary bodies, which it either funded or which received Home Office funding but which reported to ACPO:\n\nACPO Criminal Records Office\nThe ACPO Criminal Records Office (ACRO) was set up in 2006 in response to a perceived gap in the police service's ability to manage criminal records and in particular to improve links to biometric data. The initial aim of ACRO was to provide operational support relating to criminal records and associated biometric data, including DNA and fingerprint recognition.\n\nIt also issues police certificates, for a fee, needed to obtain immigration visas for countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.\n\nThe organization continues under the style \"ACRO Criminal Records Office\" under the control of Hampshire Constabulary.\n\nACPO Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS), later the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NAVCIS), was managed by ACPO, and was responsible for combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime.\n\nNational Community Tension Team\nThe National Community Tension Team (NCTT) was an ACPO body which monitored religious, racial, or other tensions within communities, and provided liaison between police forces and community organisations.\n\nNational Counter Terrorism Security Office\nThe National Counter Terrorism Security Office was funded by, and reported to, ACPO and advised the British government on its counter terrorism strategy.\n\nPolice National Information and Co-ordination Centre\nACPO was responsible for coordinating the national mobilisation of police resources at times of national need through the Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre (PNICC), which it set up in 2003. This included ensuring policing resilience during major events such as emergency response to serious flooding or the investigation of a terrorist attack. PNICC sat alongside the government in COBR (Cabinet Office Briefing Room) to advise on national issues. PNICC also handled support to overseas crises involving UK nationals.\n\nIt employed three full-time staff, with other staff seconded to it as needed and is funded by contributions from each of the police forces.\n\nCounter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit\n\nThe Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) was set up in 2010 by ACPO (and run by the Metropolitan Police) to remove unlawful terrorist material content from the Internet with a focus on UK based material.\n\nThe December 2013 report of the Prime Minister's Extremism task force said that it would \"work with internet companies to restrict access to terrorist material online which is hosted overseas but illegal under UK law\" and \"work with the internet industry to help them in their continuing efforts to identify extremist content to include in family-friendly filters\" which would likely involve lobbying ISPs to add the CTIRU list to their filters without the need for additional legislation.\n\nNational Wildlife Crime Unit\nThe National Wildlife Crime Unit is a national police unit that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies.\n\nControversies\n\nFreedom of information\nACPO had been criticised as being unaccountable to Parliament or the public by virtue of its limited company status. In October 2009 Sir Hugh Orde stated that ACPO would be \"more than happy\" to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. On 30 March 2010, the Ministry of Justice announced that ACPO would be included under the FOI Act from October 2011. In its response, the organisation stated that \"Although organisations cannot voluntarily comply with the Act, a large proportion of ACPO's work is public already or available under FOI through any police force\". In January 2011 its website still said it: \"is unable to do is to respond to requests for information under the Act. The organisation is too small and there are too few members of staff to be able to conduct the necessary research and to compile the responses\". From November 2011, however, FOI requests could be made to ACPO.\n\nConfidential Intelligence Unit\nIn February 2009, the Mail on Sunday highlighted the involvement of ACPO in setting up the \"Confidential Intelligence Unit\" as a specialised unit to monitor left-wing and right-wing political groups throughout the UK.\n\nCommercial activities\nThe February 2009 Mail on Sunday investigation also highlighted other activities of the ACPO including selling information from the Police National Computer for \u00a370 despite it costing them only 60p to access it, marketing \"police approval\" logos to firms selling anti-theft devices and operating a separate private firm offering training to speed camera operators.\n\nApartments\nThe organisation was criticised in February 2010 for allegedly spending \u00a31.6 million per year from government anti-terrorist funding grants on renting up to 80 apartments in the centre of London which were reported as being empty most of the time. The organisation responded that it had reviewed this policy and would reduce the number of apartments.\n\nUndercover activities\nAs a result of The Guardian articles with regards to the activities and accusations of PC Mark Kennedy of the National Public Order Intelligence Unit within the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit, and the collapse of the subsequent trial of six activists, a number of initiatives and changes were announced:\nAcknowledging that \"something had gone very wrong\" in the Kennedy case to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Home Office minister Nick Herbert stated that ACPO would lose control of three teams involved in tackling domestic extremism. Herbert announced that the units would be transferred to the Metropolitan Police, with acting commissioner Tim Godwin confirming that this would occur at the earliest possible timescale.\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary announced that Bernard Hogan-Howe would lead an investigation into ACPO, to assess whether undercover operations had been \"authorised in accordance with law\" and \"proportionate\".\nThe Association of Police Authorities said it was ending its annual \u00a3850,000 grant to ACPO.\n\nDNA database\n\nACPO has supervised the creation of one of the world's largest per-capita DNA databases, containing the DNA profiles of more than one million innocent people. ACPO's guidelines that these profiles should only be deleted in \"exceptional circumstances\" were found to be unlawful by the UK Supreme Court in May 2011. They were found to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, following the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in S and Marper v United Kingdom. On 1 May 2012, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 completed its passage through Parliament and received Royal Assent. To date, ACPO has not reissued revised guidelines to replace its unlawful DNA exceptional procedure. Big Brother Watch, in a report of June 2012, concludes that despite the Protection of Freedoms Act, the retention of DNA in England and Wales remains an uncertain and illiberal regime.\n\nFake uniforms\n\nDuring the summer of 2011, Hugh Orde, then president of the ACPO, was seen wearing a dark blue police-style uniform with ACPO insignia, and was accused of wearing a fake uniform. Senior police officers claimed that the uniform was not that of any police force in the country but \"closely resembled\" the uniform worn by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Paul Stephenson. Sam Leith, an author, journalist and literary editor of The Spectator, mocked Orde's decision \"to wear this Gadaffi-style pretend uniform on television\", and suggested it was \"a subliminal pitch for the Met Commissioner's job.\" Brian Paddick, at the time the Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, said: \"It's unusual for the president of ACPO to appear in all these interviews in uniform. He is sending a clear signal: how would I look in the commissioner's uniform?\" One officer noted: \"If anything, Hugh should be wearing the uniform of the Police Service of Northern Ireland because that's where he served. But their uniform is green, not the dark blue he currently wears.\" An ACPO spokesperson stated that the \"Police Reform Act 2002 states that the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers holds the rank of chief constable. Not being a member of a particular force, the President wears a generic police uniform\".\n\nParker Review \nIn 2013, an independent review of ACPO by General Sir Nick Parker was published. It recommended that ACPO be replaced by a new body, in the interests of greater transparency and cost effectiveness.  On the basis of these recommendations, a new organization, the National Police Chiefs' Council, was set up to replace ACPO, which it did on 1 April 2015.\n\nNotable members \n\n Commander Christine Jones (Metropolitan Police), lead on mental health issues\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Association of Chief Police Officers website (archived link from March 2015)\n \n\n \nCategory:Law enforcement in England and Wales\nCategory:Law enforcement in Northern Ireland\nCategory:Organizations established in 1948\nCategory:British intelligence agencies\nCategory:Privately held companies of the United Kingdom\nCategory:Counter-intelligence agencies\nCategory:1948 establishments in the United Kingdom\nCategory:2015 disestablishments in the United Kingdom\nCategory:Law enforcement-related professional associations", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

{"text": "\u0160eduva\n\n\u0160eduva () is a city in the Radvili\u0161kis district municipality, Lithuania. It is located  east of Radvili\u0161kis.\n\n\u0160eduva was an agricultural town dealing in  cereals, flax and linseed, pigs and geese and horses, at the site of a royal estate and beside a road from Kaunas to Riga.   The population from the fifteenth century was Catholic and Jewish. Until then, Lithuania had been the last pagan kingdom in Europe and allowed freedom of worship and toleration of Jews and other religions. The first Catholic shrine of \u0160eduva, the Church of the Invention of the Holy Cross, was built and the parish founded between 1512 and 1529.  The present brick church Cross was built in \u0160eduva in 1643 with a donation from bishop Jurgis Ti\u0161kevi\u010dius of Vilnius. During the 18th century the bell tower was added to the structure, with further renovations and extensions in 1905.  Baroque and renaissance architectural styles characterise both the exterior and interior of the church. It has a cruciform plan with an apse, low sacristy and five altars.\n\nDuring the 15th century the region was redefined as the Voivodeship of Trakai and Vilnius. Later it became part of  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Union of Lublin in 1569 created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe \u0160eduva coat of arms were granted on June 25, 1654 by John II Casimir Vasa, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania and at the same time the city was granted burger rights at the request of Maria Ludvika, Queen of Poland. She descended from the Princes of Gonzaga, from Mantua in Italy. The arms of the family showed a black eagle. The small breastshield shows the French fleur-de-lis, because the Gonzaga family was related to the French Royal family.  The eagle was made white in reference to the white eagle of Poland.\n\n1792 Stanislaw II August Poniatowski, the last royal proprietor of \u0160eduva, concluded an agreement with the town's citizens, giving them rights to be excused from labour on the estate for a fee.  In 1795, the year of a terrible fire in \u0160eduva,  Lithuania became part of Russia when Poland was partitioned.  From 1798, Baron Theodore von Ropp did not acknowledge the rights of \u0160eduva citizens and required of the citizens to perform labour in the town's manor. The citizens  petitioned for their rights  to the Russian Senate. In 1812, the Senate passed the decision to recognise the former charters of \u0160eduva.\n\nBetween 1696 and 1762, a Jesuit mission, connected with their college at Pa\u0161iau\u0161\u0117, was active in the town, operating a lower school with 96 pupils up until 1828.  After an insurrection in 1863 (the January Uprising), all parish schools in \u0160eduva were closed and replaced by public Russian language schools. In the same year a Russian Orthodox Church, designed by the architect Ustinas Golinevicius, was built and in 1866 a wooden Synagogue was added near the central market square.\n\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and Communist Russia  in August 1939 and the German-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty a month later placed Lithuania under  Soviet control.   By June 1940 the Soviets had set up a pro-Soviet government and stationed many Red Army troops in Lithuania as part of the Mutual Assistance Pact between the countries. President Antanas Smetona was forced to leave as 15 Red Army divisions came in.\n\nThe  pro-Soviet puppet government was controlled by Vladimir Dekanozov and Justas Paleckis, and Lithuania was made part of the  Soviet Union. A Sovietisation programme began immediately. Land, banks and large businesses were nationalised. All religious, cultural, and political organizations were abolished except the Communist party. 17,000 people  were deported to Siberia, where many would perish.\n\nDuring the years of Lithuanian anti-Soviet partisan resistance (1944\u20131953) in \u0160eduva and neighbouring districts Lithuanian \u017dalioji rinktin\u0117 (The Green Squad), belonging to partisans' Algimantas military district was active.\n\nIndustry\n\n\u0160eduva is famous for sheep farming, Lithuanian Black-headed sheep are grown. The state enterprise \u0160eduvos avininkyst\u0117 is responsible for the preservation of the genetic stock of Lithuanian Black-Headed sheep.\n\nThe Holocaust in Shadeve\n\nThe German army invaded Lithuania on 22 June 1941, taking Shadova - \u0160eduva a few days later as part of Operation Barbarossa. At first the Lithuanian population considered the Nazis to be liberators saving them from the Red Army. Five hundred years of Jewish life in Shadova - \u0160eduva ended in just two days of slaughter.  Shadova's Jews attempted to flee east to Russia but were badly treated by Lithuanian nationalists and most returned to their homes. The German forces entered Shadova - \u0160eduva on 25 June 1941 and were received with flowers by many locals.  By the beginning of July, Jews had to wear the yellow Star of David.  Jews who had participated in the  Soviet  rule were immediately arrested and executed.   Jews  were taken to dismantle the remnants of the munitions factory in Linkai\u010diai, and were then accused of stealing and  executed. Others were forced into labour gangs.  They were set to work cleaning the streets and at the warehouses of the rail station.  All the work was guarded  by armed Lithuanian militi. Next all the Jews of Shadova - \u0160eduva had to gather in the market place with no more than a small package each, and to hand over the keys to their houses to the police. Under guard, they were escorted at night to the village of Pavarty\u010diai, five kilometres north-west of Shadova - \u0160eduva, where they were crowded into two unfinished Soviet barracks surrounded with barbed wire.  The Jews were ordered to hand over all their valuables and cash.  Some were shot in the next few days.\n\nOn 25 August 1941 the remaining Jews of Shadova - \u0160eduva were loaded on trucks and taken to Liaudi\u0161kiai, ten kilometres south-west of the town where the Rollcommando Hamann of Einsatzcommando 3 and Lithuanian collaborators of  the 3rd company of the Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas were waiting for them.  Over the coming two days the entire Jewish community of Shadova was shot and buried in two pre-prepared mass graves.  One site was located 400 meters north of the Shadova - \u0160eduva road and a second 900 meters north west of the same road, close to a path in the forest. The lists of mass graves in the book The Popular Massacres of Lithuania, Part II, include the following: Liaudiskiai forest about 10\u00a0km southwest of \u0160eduva, one site 400 meters north of the \u0160eduva road and a second site 900 meters northwest of the same road, close to a path in the forest. The J\u00e4ger report concludes that Einsatzcommando 3 registered the murder in \u0160eduva on the 25 and 26 August 1941 of 230 Jewish men, 275 Jewish women and 159 Jewish children, a total of 664 people.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The murder of the Jews of \u0160eduva during World War II, at Yad Vashem website.\n\nCategory:Cities in Lithuania\nCategory:Cities in \u0160iauliai County\nCategory:Trakai Voivodeship\nCategory:Shavelsky Uyezd\nCategory:Holocaust locations in Lithuania\nCategory:Radvili\u0161kis District Municipality", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

Morris was also named NSCAA Washington State Player of the Year and NSCAA High School All-American in 2012.\n\nHe joined the Sounders FC youth academy and played in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy for one season. On February 6, 2012, Morris signed a letter of intent to play college soccer at Stanford University.\n\nIn his freshman year with the Cardinal, Morris appeared in all 21 matches and led all Pac-12 freshman with seven assists and 19 points and tied for the lead with six goals and helped lead his team to their first NCAA Tournament since 2009 where they would eventually fall 1\u20130 to #2 seed Washington in the Round of 16. He went on to be named first team All-Pac-12 that year. Morris also spent time with Seattle Sounders FC U-23 in the Premier Development League.\n\nIn his sophomore year, Morris helped lead Stanford to its first Pac-12 championship since 2001.\n\nIn his junior year, Morris scored 13 goals and had 3 assists. He led the Cardinal to both the Pac-12 and the NCAA Championships. In the NCAA tournament, Morris scored 5 of Stanford's total of 12 goals. In the championship game against Clemson, Morris scored his first of two goals in the game only 87 seconds into the contest.\n\nOn January 8, 2016, Morris was awarded the Hermann Trophy as the best player in NCAA Division I soccer.\n\nSeattle Sounders\nAfter winning the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship, there was speculation that Morris would begin to play professionally. Coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann stated that Morris \"obviously has to\" turn pro. On January 5, 2016, Morris announced he decided to forgo his senior season at Stanford to turn pro. It was widely speculated that Morris would sign with the Sounders, the club for which his father works, and also holds his amateur rights. On January 21, 2016, Morris signed with Seattle Sounders FC, being given MLS's highest-ever Homegrown Player contract worth roughly $250,000 a year. He joined the Sounders' preseason training camp in Arizona, debuting in a friendly against Celaya F.C. on February 9, 2016. On February 23, 2016, Morris made his professional debut against Club Am\u00e9rica in the CONCACAF Champions League, starting the match. The following week, he debuted in the Sounders' first Major League Soccer game of the season against Sporting Kansas City.\n\nMorris scored his first Major League Soccer goal for the Sounders on April 16, 2016, against the Philadelphia Union. He then went on to score in his next three consecutive games, matching the Seattle rookie scoring record, his next goal then surpassed the rookie goalscoring record which had been set by Steve Zakuani in 2009. He has since helped his team to win the MLS Cup after a run from ninth place into fourth, along with the help of Nicolas Lodeiro, a new midseason acquisition made by Seattle.\n\nOn February 22, 2018 while playing in El Salvador against Santa Tecla in the Sounders' first match of the 2018 CONCACAF Champions League, Morris collapsed untouched in the 85th minute with a torn ACL. He was reported to likely miss 6\u20139 months. After missing the entirety of the 2018 MLS season, Morris was signed to a five-year contract extension with the Sounders in December 2018.\n\nWerder Bremen trial\nOn January 5, 2016, it was reported that Morris was set to train with Werder Bremen at their winter camp, which Bremen chief executive Thomas Eichin claimed was \"an opportunity for us to get to know the player better. Nothing more and nothing less\". On January 13, 2016, it was reported that Bremen extended the trial of Morris who then played in a friendly match against Inter Baku PIK and recorded an assist. On January 18, 2016, it was reported that Bremen had offered a contract to Morris, and Eichin claimed he was confident that they would sign him. However, it was later reported by Werder Bremen that Morris had turned down their offer in favor of playing in the United States.\n\nInternational career\n\nIn May 2013, Morris was one of 22 players named to the U.S. under-20 squad for the Toulon Tournament where he made three appearances. He also made appearances for the U.S. under-23 national team on August 6, 2014 and scored in a 5\u20131 win over Barbados.\n\nOn August 28, 2014, Morris received his first senior call up to the U.S. men's national team for a friendly against the Czech Republic, making him the first college player to be called into squad since Chris Albright was called up in 1999 while he was still playing at the University of Virginia. While he was left on the bench, he would make his international debut in a 4\u20131 defeat to Ireland in November.\n\nOn April 15, 2015, he scored his first U.S. men's national team goal against Mexico in an international friendly. In the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final, Morris scored the winning goal for the United States, assuring a victory over Jamaica and becoming joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals.\n\nInternational goals\nAs of matches played November 19, 2019. Scores and results list the United States's goal tally first.\n\nPersonal life\nMorris was born in Seattle, Washington, to Michael and Leslie Morris. His father, Dr. Michael Morris, is the chief medical director of Seattle Sounders FC. He has three siblings named Christopher, Julian and Talia. He attended Mercer Island High School, where he played high school soccer prior to joining the Sounders Academy.\n\nMorris was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of nine and is one of the few professional athletes with the condition to play. He said that having diabetes has helped shape him.

The film stars Sharib Hashmi, Jyotii Sethi, and Nutan Surya which is inspired from the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social activist from Tamil Nadu. \n\nPhullu is about Phullu, an errand boy who eventually makes low-cost menstruation pads.\n\nPlot\n\nPhullu  the titular character (portrayed by Sharib Hashmi) that's the typical good guy. Phullu's mother sells quilts because he doesn't have a job. He helps out his mom by procuring all the raw material for the quilts from the nearby town. In addition, he also picks up all the other stuff the women in his village may need from there.\n\nWhen Phullu gets married, he realises that his wife keeps taking away pieces of red cloth from the material he gathers for the quilts. He wonders about it, but doesn't connect the dots as he knows nothing about menstruation. Neither his wife or mother explain the concept to him.\n\nThe women in his life also want Phullu to move to a big city and find work. But he's adamant about staying back in the village.\n\nFinally, a turning point in Phullu's life comes when he finds out about menstruation through a female doctor at a chemist's shop on one of his city visits. He finally begins to understand why his wife needs the cloth, and why she suffers from itching every night.\n\nHe then takes rather drastic step of using all the money reserved for the last installment payment for his sister's jewellery to get a whole lot of sanitary pads. His furious mother kicks him out of the house, saying that he's wasted the money she earned with so much difficulty. When he tries to protest that the sanitary napkins are more important, his mother says her grandmother used wood to get rid of the itching and went on to live for 102 years, so pads are irrelevant.\n\nPhullu goes to the city, where he gets in touch with the doctor who'd educated him about menstruation. He manages to create a sanitary napkin of his own. However, his mother and sister refuse to test it, as do the other women in the village for whom he used to run errands in the city. His wife is pregnant at this time, so she can't help him out either but is in how supportive Phullu's wife is, of his endeavour to manufacture low-cost sanitary napkins.\n\nSee also\n Pad Man\n Period.

{"text": "Frithy and Chadacre Woods\n\nFrithy and Chadacre Woods is a 28.7 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in the parishes of Lawshall and Shimpling in Suffolk, England.\n\nDescription\nThree ancient and semi-natural woods form the SSSI, namely Frithy Wood in Lawshall parish and Ashen Wood and Bavins Wood on the Chadacre Estate in Shimpling parish.\n\nAll three woods are of the wet ash (Fraxinus excelsior) / maple (Acer campestre) type, with hazel (Corylus avellana) also present in considerable quantity. There are pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) trees and other tree and shrub species include aspen (Populus tremula), wild cherry (Prunus avium), midland hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), crab apple (Malus sylvestris), holly (Ilex aquifolium), spindle (Euonymus europaeus) and common dogwood (Cornus sanguinea). The structure of the woods has been greatly influenced by management of the coppice.\n\nThe three woods have a diverse woodland floor vegetation, which is dominated by either dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis) or brambles (Rubus spp.). They contain a number of plants characteristic of woodlands of this type including herb paris (Paris quadrifolia) in Ashen Wood and wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides), woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea) and stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) in Frithy Wood. The SSSI lies within the distribution of oxlip (Primula elatior) and all three woods contain this species. There are many other woodland floor plants including early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), twayblade (Neottia ovata), gromwell (Lithospermum officinale) and bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scriptus).\n\nThere are several well-vegetated rides in the group of woods that support a mixture of woodland and meadow plant species and which attract considerable numbers of common butterflies. Frithy Wood also contains an area of pasture which projects into the wood which is partly shaded by a number of standard trees.\n\nThe birdlife of Frithy Wood has been recorded in detail with species including the nightingale, European green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker and lesser spotted woodpecker which breed regularly.\n\nRoe deer, fallow deer and muntjac can also be seen in the woods but they have caused considerable damage to the ground vegetation.\n\nForest school\nForest school sessions are held in Frithy Wood by permission of the landowners.  The 'school' represents an initiative of All Saints Primary School, Lawshall and the Green Light Trust, an environmental and educational charity.\n\nHistory\nOliver Rackham has stated that \"a wood now called The Frith is almost certain to be pre-conquest, from Old English Fyrhp.\"  In a later book he stated that \"an Anglo-Saxon (parallel) is fyrth, a wood, which has given rise to many Frith or Frithy Woods.\"  \n\nThere is documentary evidence for the existence of Frithy (formerly Frith) Wood back to 1545 and its Saxon name would imply that the wood is much older than that.  All three woods are part of ancient woodland and contain broad boundary banks and ditches typical of coppice woods dating from the medieval period or before.\n\nIn more recent times in the twentieth century pigs were kept in Frithy Wood and at one time the wood extended as far as The Street.\n\nNewspaper records\nOn 31 August 1921 it was reported in the Suffolk Free Press that the remains of George Nunn aged 55 of Lawshall were discovered hanging in Frithy Wood.

Elected to parliament in 1924 at the age of 21, he was the first British MP to have been born in the 20th century.\n\nFamily\nWarrand's father was Hugh Munro Warrand (8 July 1870 \u2013 11 June 1935, married 24 April 1901), Major in the 3rd Battalion of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and son of Alexander John Cruikshank Warrand of Bught, Inverness-shire.\n\nWarrand's mother Beatrice Maude Lucas Lucas-Tooth (died 25 June 1944) was a daughter of Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth, 1st Baronet.

His sister Beatrice Helen Fitzhardinge Warrand (born 1908), married on 27 September 1941 another World War II veteran, Lieutenant Colonel Lyndall Fownes Urwick, Military Cross, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, son of Sir Henry Urwick of Malvern, Worcestershire, Justice of the Peace.\n\nBiography\nWarrand was educated at Eton College, and graduated from Balliol College in 1924 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He adopted the legally changed name Hugh Vere Huntly Duff Lucas-Tooth of Teanich by Royal Licence in 1920 when he gained the recreated baronetcy of his maternal grandfather, the first baronet, whose three sons had died in World War I, being created 1st Baronet Lucas-Tooth, of Bught, County Inverness, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 1 December 1920, with special remainder to the heirs male of the body of his mother.\n\nLucas-Tooth was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1924 general election as Conservative Member of Parliament for the Isle of Ely from October 1924 to May 1929. Aged 21, he became the youngest MP, known as \"Baby of the House\". He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Arthur Samuel, Secretary for Overseas Trade. Lucas-Tooth was called to the bar in 1933 at Lincoln's Inn entitled to practise as a barrister. He also became a lieutenant colonel in the service of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.\n\nDuring the 1930s Lucas-Tooth helped established the Lucas-Tooth gymnasium at Tooley Street in south London for the benefit of unemployed men from the Northern coalfields and unemployed areas. A new style of physical exercises helped improve the fitness of these men. It was featured in a British Pathe newsreel in 1938 titled 'Fit \u2013 Fitter \u2013 Fittest'.\n\nHe was defeated in the 1929 general election by the Liberal candidate, James A. de Rothschild. Lucas-Tooth stood again for parliament in the 1945 general election for Hendon South, and was elected, taking his seat in July 1945. He retained the seat in subsequent general elections until 1970 and was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department between February 1952 and December 1955.\n\nOn 3 February 1965 Lucas-Tooth legally changed his name once again by Deed Poll to Hugh Vere Huntly Duff Munro-Lucas-Tooth of Teaninich, to reflect the Scottish lairdship Munro of Teaninich.\n\nHe retired from Parliament at the 1970 general election.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married on 10 September 1925 Laetitia Florence Findlay (died 1978), daughter of Sir John Ritchie Findlay, 1st Baronet, of Aberlour; the couple had three children, Laetitia (born 1926), Jennifer (born 1929), and Hugh (born 1932).

{"text": "Stern John\n\nStern John, CM (born 30 October 1976) is a Trinidadian football manager and former player who is currently managing Central F.C. in the TT Pro League. He previously played for a number of American and English football clubs that included Columbus Crew, Bristol City, Nottingham Forest, Birmingham City, Sunderland, Southampton, Crystal Palace, Coventry City and Derby County.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly Career in US\nJohn was born in Tunapuna, Trinidad and Tobago and moved to the United States to attend Mercer County Community College in 1995. He joined the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer (MLS) from the now-defunct New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers of the A-League for the 1998 season. On the recommendation of his older cousin, Columbus Crew defender and Trinidad and Tobago international, Ansil Elcock, John received a try-out with Crew, where he became one of the most prolific scorers in league history. In 1998, John led the league with 26 goals, a record that currently puts him tied for fifth in MLS for goals in one season, and also with 57 points to be named the MLS Scoring Champion. He was named to the MLS Best XI that year as well, and tied for the lead with 18 goals in 1999.\n\nNottingham Forest\nAfter the 1999 season with Columbus, John was acquired by Nottingham Forest of the English First Division for a fee of \u00a31.5\u00a0million. However, eventual financial difficulties at Forest following the team's failed bid at promotion forced John's sale to Birmingham City in February 2002, then pushing for promotion to the Premier League, for the sum of \u00a3100,000. John scored 18 goals in 49 starts for Forest.\n\nBirmingham City\nAt Birmingham, John rarely played, although he had some memorable moments in the blue shirt of Birmingham, such as his turn and finish away at West Ham in 2002; his last minute equaliser at Villa Park in the Birmingham derby; and his last minute goal away at Millwall which put Birmingham through to the Playoff Final in 2002. He then scored one of the penalties in the play-off final shootout to help them get promoted to the Premier League. Popular with the Birmingham fans for his crucial and sometimes brilliant goals, he nonetheless fell out of favour with management, and was sold to Coventry City on 14 September 2004.\n\nCoventry City\nIn his first season with Coventry, John finished second in team scoring with 12 goals despite starting in barely half of Coventry's games.\n\nDerby County\n\nAt the start of the 2005\u201306 season, following the signing of James Scowcroft, John found himself outside of manager Micky Adams's first-team plans. As a result, he was loaned to Derby County on 16 September 2005. He rejoined Coventry three months later.\n\nSunderland\nOn 29 January 2007, John was transferred to Sunderland for an undisclosed fee. The signing was Sunderland manager Roy Keane's sixth signing of the 2006\u201307 season January transfer window. He scored his first goals against Southend United in a 4\u20130 victory on 17 February 2007.\n\nSouthampton\nOn 29 August 2007, John moved to Southampton as part of a deal that took his international teammate Kenwyne Jones in the opposite direction.\n\nHe scored his first goals with two in a 3\u20132 win against West Bromwich Albion on 6 October 2007. From then on he scored regularly for \"The Saints\", with nine goals in his first fifteen appearances, including a second half hat trick against Hull City on 8 December 2007. He finished the 2007\u201308 season fourth highest scorer in the Championship with 19 goals for Southampton. (He had also scored once for Sunderland in the Premier League prior to his transfer.) Before being sent off for a second bookable offence, John scored two goals, including the match winner, in Southampton's final game of the season against Sheffield United, as the Saints narrowly avoided relegation to League One.\n\nBristol City\n\nJohn was loaned to Bristol City in October 2008 until the end of the 2008\u201309 season. John made his first Bristol City appearance, coming on as a substitute, against Barnsley in a 0\u20130 draw. John scored his first goal for Bristol City in a 4\u20131 defeat to Reading at Ashton Gate Stadium on 1 November 2008.\n\nCrystal Palace\nOn 29 July 2009 John signed for Crystal Palace on a year-long deal after turning down an offer to stay at Southampton. He made his debut on the opening day of the season against Plymouth Argyle, he had to come off after 35 minutes due to an injury. He returned in mid-October, but joined Ipswich Town on a one-month loan at the end of November. He scored his first goal for Ipswich in a 3\u20132 win over Coventry City on 16 January 2010. Upon his return to Palace he scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 win at Watford on 30 March 2010.\nNew Palace manager George Burley had hoped to discuss the player's future at the end of the season, but no discussion occurred, and John left the club.\n\nSolihull Moors\nIn August 2012, after two seasons out of English football, John returned, signing for Solihull Moors. However, as of November 2012, he had yet to make an appearance in any competition for the club.\n\nWASA FC\nJohn retired and moved back to his native Trinidad and Tobago after his spell at Solihull Moors. He came out of retirement a second time in order to join WASA FC of the National Super League of Trinidad and Tobago in January 2014. He scored on his debut\n\nCentral F.C.\nJohn came out of retirement once again in 2016 when he was appointed as player-coach of Central F.C. in the TT Pro League.\n\nInternational career\nJohn made his international debut for Trinidad and Tobago national football team on 15 February 1995 against Finland in a Friendly match at the Queen's Park Oval, scoring one goal on his debut. John has been a vital player for the Soca Warriors, currently the team's all-time leading scorer with 70 goals in 115 caps (as of 9 February 2011), and is also the 7th highest international goalscorer according to the list of Top international association football goal scorers by country, behind Pel\u00e9, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s and Ali Daei. He is also the all-time top CONCACAF goal scorer. He was instrumental in helping his country qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and played in all three of his country's World Cup group matches at Germany 2006. In Germany, he scored an offside goal. He was also named Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation Player of the Year in 2002. John is currently the second most capped Trinidad and Tobago international behind former teammate Angus Eve. He was the only player to score in 12 consecutive international matches, from 1998 to 1999.\n\nHonours\n 1998 MLS Scoring Champion\n 1998 MLS Golden Boot\n 1998 MLS Best XI\n 2002 Division 1 Play-offs Winner's Medal\n 2002 Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation Player of the Year\n 2007 Championship Winners' Medal with Sunderland\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub statistics\n\nInternational goals\nScores and results list Trinidad and Tobago's goal tally first.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPlayer profile from Southampton F.C. website (via archive.org)\n\nCategory:1976 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:People from Tunapuna\u2013Piarco\nCategory:Trinidad and Tobago footballers\nCategory:Association football forwards\nCategory:Mercer County Community College alumni\nCategory:Carolina Dynamo players\nCategory:New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers players\nCategory:Columbus Crew SC players\nCategory:Nottingham Forest F.C. players\nCategory:Birmingham City F.C. players\nCategory:Coventry City F.C. players\nCategory:Derby County F.C. players\nCategory:Sunderland A.F.C. players\nCategory:Southampton F.C. players\nCategory:Bristol City F.C. players\nCategory:Crystal Palace F.C. players\nCategory:Ipswich Town F.C. players\nCategory:North East Stars F.C. players\nCategory:Solihull Moors F.C. players\nCategory:USISL players\nCategory:USL First Division players\nCategory:Major League Soccer players\nCategory:Major League Soccer All-Stars\nCategory:Premier League players\nCategory:English Football League players\nCategory:TT Pro League players\nCategory:Trinidad and Tobago international footballers\nCategory:1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup players\nCategory:2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup players\nCategory:2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup players\nCategory:2006 FIFA World Cup players\nCategory:FIFA Century Club\nCategory:Trinidad and Tobago expatriate footballers\nCategory:Trinidad and Tobago expatriate sportspeople in the United States\nCategory:Trinidad and Tobago expatriate sportspeople in England\nCategory:Expatriate soccer players in the United States\nCategory:Expatriate footballers in England\nCategory:Trinidad and Tobago football managers\nCategory:Central F.C. managers\nCategory:TT Pro League managers\nCategory:Recipients of the Chaconia Medal", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

{"text": "Scott Report\n\nThe Scott Report (the Report of the Inquiry into the Export of Defence Equipment and Dual-Use Goods to Iraq and Related Prosecutions) was a judicial inquiry commissioned in 1992 after reports of arms sales to Iraq in the 1980s by British companies surfaced. The report was conducted by Sir Richard Scott, then a Lord Justice of Appeal. It was published in 1996. Much of the report was secret.\n\nBackground\nIn the late 1980s, Matrix Churchill, a British (Coventry) aerospace quality machine tools manufacturer that had been bought by the Iraqi government, was exporting machines used in weapons manufacture to Iraq. According to the International Atomic Energy Authority, the products later found in Iraq were among the highest quality of their kind in the world. They were 'dual use' machines that could be used to manufacture weapons parts. Such exports are subject to government control, and Matrix Churchill had the appropriate government permissions, following a 1988 relaxation of export controls. Crucially, however, this relaxation had not been announced to Parliament \u2013 indeed, when asked in Parliament whether controls had been relaxed, the then-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry replied incorrectly that they had not.\n\nMatrix Churchill was contacted by HM Customs and Excise, under suspicion of exporting arms components to Iraq without permission. It had this permission but this was denied by the government, in line with the most recently announced policy on the matter. Matrix Churchill's directors were therefore prosecuted in 1991 by Customs and Excise for breaching export controls.\n\nThe trial did not go well for the government \u2013 public interest immunity certificates obtained by the government to suppress some critical evidence (supposedly on grounds of national security) were quickly overturned by the trial judge, forcing the documents to be handed over to the defence. The trial eventually collapsed when former minister Alan Clark admitted he had been 'economical with the actualit\u00e9 in answer to parliamentary questions regarding what he knew about export licenses to Iraq.\n\nReport\nThe Scott Report represents possibly the most exhaustive study produced to that date of the individual responsibility of ministers to Parliament. Scott comments on the difficulty of extracting from departments the required documents (some 130,000 of them in all) and notes how Customs and Excise could not find out what Ministry of Defence export policy was, and how intelligence reports were not passed on to those who needed to know. The Economist commented that \"Sir Richard exposed an excessively secretive government machine, riddled with incompetence, slippery with the truth and willing to mislead Parliament\". The report characterised the nature of the government as:\n\nScott identified three main areas of democratic concern. First, the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 was emergency legislation passed at the outbreak of the Second World War. It allowed the government to issue regulations which were not subject to resolutions in Parliament, for the duration of the emergency, which would make it a criminal offence to export particular goods to particular countries. While the Act should have been lapsed in 1945, it remained in force, and had been modified in 1990 so as to become part of the Import and Export Control Act 1990.\n\nThe second area was the failure of ministerial accountability; the principle that \"for every action of a servant of the crown a minister is answerable to Parliament\".\n\nThe third area was that of public-interest immunity certificates, which had been issued during the Matrix Churchill trial. As a result of these certificates, innocent men were in danger of being sent to prison, because the government would not allow the defence counsel to see the documents that would exonerate their clients.  While some of these contained potentially sensitive intelligence material, many were simply internal communications: the certificates were intended to protect the ministers and civil servants who had written the communications, rather than the public interest. Scott states:\n\nPublication \nThe publication of the report was seen by many as the nadir of the 1990s Conservative governments of the UK. Prior to the report's publication, those ministers who were criticised were given the opportunity to comment and request revisions. The 1,806-page report was published, along with a press pack which included a few relatively positive extracts from the report presented as if representative of the entire report, at 3:30pm. Given a then largely pro-government press, this proved effective at stalling an extensive analysis in the media.\n\nThe report had to be debated in Parliament. Ministers criticised in the report were given advanced access to the report and briefed extensively on how to defend themselves against the report's criticisms. In contrast, according to senior Labour MP Robin Cook, the opposition were given just two hours to read the million-plus words, during which scrutiny they were supervised and prevented from making copies of the report. Finally, the Prime Minister, John Major, stated that a vote against the Government would be in effect a vote of no confidence, ensuring that Conservative MPs would not vote against, while a vote for was a vote exonerating the Government of any wrongdoing. Robin Cook worked with a team of researchers to scrutinise the report, and delivered \"what was regarded as a bravura performance\". Nonetheless, the Government won the vote 320\u2013319.\n\nReferences \n\n Commentary by David Butler\n Q&A: The Scott Report, BBC News\n Robin Cook's obituary, BBC News.\n\nCategory:1992 in the United Kingdom\nCategory:1996 in the United Kingdom\nCategory:Public inquiries in the United Kingdom\nCategory:Judicial inquiries", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

{"text": "Interstate 265\n\nInterstate 265 (I-265) is a  Interstate Highway encircling the Louisville, Kentucky, metropolitan area, which includes Southern Indiana. In Kentucky, it travels through Jefferson County, from I-65 in the southern part of Louisville, meeting I-65 again in Indiana, where the road continues west to I-64, where it ends.\n\nThe entire Kentucky stretch of the road is co-signed with Kentucky Route\u00a0841 (KY\u00a0841). An additional  stretch of freeway between US\u00a031W/US\u00a060/KY\u00a01934 and I-65 in the south part of Louisville is solely designated as KY\u00a0841. The highway is named the Gene Snyder Freeway (originally named the Jefferson Freeway), after the former congressman, and usually called \"the Snyder\" by locals. It is considered part of Louisville's beltline.\n\nRoute description\n\n|-\n| IN || 13.1 || 21.1\n|-\n| KY || 38.9 || 62.6\n|-\n| Total || 52 || 83.7\n|}\n\nIndiana\n\nInterstate 265 (I-265) in the U.S. state of Indiana presently runs  from I-64 at the western edge of New Albany to the Lewis and Clark Bridge near Utica. Beginning at its western terminus, the freeway is concurrent with Indiana State Road 62 until Exit 10.\n\nKentucky\nInterstate 265 (I-265) in the U.S. state of Kentucky presently runs  from the Lewis and Clark Bridge in northern Louisville to an interchange with I-65 in southern Louisville. The entire freeway is concurrent with Kentucky Route 841.\n\nThe Gene Snyder Freeway in which KY\u00a0841 and I-265 overlap for  between I-65 and the Indiana state line has seen an increase in serious accidents. The primary factors stem from its low-level grass median which offers little to no protection for crossover incidents. Driver inattention and increased traffic and congestion has led to a decline in the overall level-of-service. In 2006, cable barriers were installed in the median for  between I-71 and I-64, with further installation possible in the near future. Part of the road is currently signed in kilometers, which is unusual in the United States.\n\nKentucky Route 841\n\nKentucky Route 841 (KY\u00a0841) is a  state highway in the suburbs of Louisville. The route is a partial beltway, encircling Louisville on its southern and eastern sides. Compass direction changes to the north and south of exit 23, Taylorsville Road interchange. The western terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 31W (US\u00a031W) and US\u00a060 in the southwest Louisville community of Valley Station, where KY\u00a0841 continues to the west as KY\u00a01934 while the northern terminus is at the Lewis and Clark Bridge and to the north of the East End Tunnel. The section between its terminus at KY\u00a01934 and I-65 is solely designated as KY\u00a0841.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally signed just as KY\u00a0841, the Jefferson Freeway was constructed originally with two sections, one between KY\u00a0155 (Taylorsville Road) and US\u00a060 (Shelbyville Road) and a second section between KY\u00a01447 (Westport Road) and US\u00a042 in the 1960s as short connectors to the eastern suburban expansion as well as a new Ford plant. I-264 by 1970 was woefully congested and was in dire need of reconstruction and other improvements, therefore I-265 was proposed as an outer beltway to provide pass-through motorists relief from the congestion of I-264. Construction started in the early 1980s and was finished later that decade and signed in 1987.\n\nThe road is signed as I-265 and KY\u00a0841 from the I-65 interchange to the Indiana state line. From I-65 west to US 31W (although it is up to Interstate Highway standards), is signed solely as KY\u00a0841 due to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials numbering rules. KY\u00a0841 is signed throughout the entire designation of I-265. The exit numbering for the entire beltway starts at the western terminus of KY\u00a0841.\n\nIndiana State Road 265\n\nThe segment of the highway between I-65 and SR 60 at Exit 10 in Indiana was formerly known as Indiana State Road 265. It was changed in June 2019 to an Interstate under approval by AASHTO.\n\nStudies have also been conducted for the reconfiguration of the I-265 and I-64 interchange. It is currently an underpowered cloverleaf with no collector\u2013distributor lanes, a relic of the original Jefferson Freeway.\n\nIn late 2005, members of the Louisville Metro Council proposed a committee to begin planning a western bridge to link the southwestern end of the highway in Kentucky to Indiana. However the proposal of the western bridge was not put into action yet.\n\nOn December 18, 2016, State Road 265 was extended east of State Road 62, which crosses the Ohio River connecting with KY 841, which was extended north of U.S. 42 in Kentucky as part of the Ohio River Bridges Project, creating a bypass around the eastern side of the city of Louisville.\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the two disjointed sections of I-265 were finally connected under AASHTO approval, with the Indiana State Road 265 designation decommissioned and replaced by I-265. However, the signage has not yet been replaced to reflect the AASHTO approval. The Kentucky Route 841 designation mostly concurrent with I-265 in Kentucky has remained.\n\nLewis and Clark Bridge\n\nIn various discussions for over 30 years, the Lewis and Clark Bridge (previously referred to as the East End Bridge) is part of a new  highway that connects State Road 265 in Indiana to KY 841 in Kentucky. The completion of the bridge connected the two disjointed highways to form a three-quarter beltway around the Louisville, Kentucky, metro area. The bridge was opened to traffic on December 18, 2016. There are currently no plans to construct a bridge on the west end of I-265.\n\nExit list\n\nSee also\n\nRoads in Louisville, Kentucky\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n KentuckyRoads.com: I-265\n\n65-2\n65-2\n65-2\n65-2 Kentucky\nCategory:Transportation in Jefferson County, Kentucky\n0265\nCategory:Transportation in Clark County, Indiana\nCategory:Transportation in Floyd County, Indiana", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

It is printed in A5-size format and is targeted at the community of approximately 1,500, 000 expatriate South Africans living in the United Kingdom.\n\nHistory\nSA Promo was founded in November 2006 by J. C. Muller and Justin Lester, who saw an opportunity after South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth post-apartheid. This allowed South Africans to apply for a working holiday visa to live and work in the United Kingdom for a period of two years. The United Kingdom saw an influx from South Africa, many of whom have subsequently settled in the country. On the 27 November 2008 the UK working holiday visa was replaced by a Point Based Visa System. The South African government does not have a reciprocal agreement with the British government and therefore no longer qualify for this category of visa. \n\nIn 2014 the SA Promo changed focus to cater for all South Africans and not just South Africans abroad.\n\nCirculation & Distribution\n\nInternationally\nWith South Africans relocating all over the world the demand for media aimed at South Africans abroad has increased. SA Promo magazine is now available as an online magazine accessible from anywhere in the world.\n\nOnline\nSA Promo magazine is available to read online, providing access to the magazine from anywhere in the world.

{"text": "Soviet prisoners of war in Finland\n\nSoviet prisoners of war in Finland during World War II were captured in two Soviet-Finnish conflicts of that period: the Winter War and the Continuation War. The Finns took about 5,700 POWs during the Winter War, and due to the short length of the war they survived relatively well. However, during the Continuation War the Finns took 64,000 POWs, of whom almost 30 percent died.\n\nWinter War\n\nThe number of Soviet prisoners of war during the Winter War (1939\u20131940) was 5,700, of whom 135 died. Most of them were captured in Finnish pockets (motti) north of Lake Ladoga. The war lasted only 105 days and most of the deceased POWs were either seriously wounded or sick. Some of the POWs, at least 152 men, enlisted in the so-called Russian Liberation Army in Finland. They were not allowed to take part in combat. After the war, some members of the Liberation Army managed to escape to a third country.\n\nContinuation War\nThe number of Soviet prisoners of war during the Continuation War (1941\u20131944) was about 64,000. Most of them were captured in 1941 (56,000 persons). The first Soviet POWs were taken in June 1941 and were transferred to reserve prisons in Karvia, K\u00f6yli\u00f6, Huittinen and Pelso (a village in modern-day municipality of Vaala). Soon Finnish administration realized that the number of POWs was much greater than initially estimated, and established 32 new prison camps in 1941\u20131944. However, all of them were not used at the same time as POWs were used as a labour force in different projects around the country.\n\nThe Finns did not pay much attention to the living conditions of the Soviet POWs at the beginning of the war, as the war was expected to be of short duration. The quantity and quality of camp personnel was very low, as the more qualified men were at the front. It was not until the middle of 1942 that the quantity and quality of camp personnel was improved. There was a shortage of labour in Finland and authorities assigned POWs to forest and agricultural work, as well as the construction of fortification lines. Some Soviet officers cooperated with the Finnish authorities and were released from prison by the end of the war.\n\nFinnic prisoners who were captured on the fronts or transferred by Germany  were separated from other Soviet POWs. At the end of 1942 volunteers could join the Finnish battalion Heimopataljoona 3, which consisted of Baltic Finns such as Karelians, Ingrian Finns, Votes and Veps.\n\nPrisoner exchange with Germany \nAbout 2,600\u20132,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans in exchange for roughly 2,200 Finnic prisoners of war held by the Germans. In November 2003, the Simon Wiesenthal Center submitted an official request to Finnish President Tarja Halonen for a full-scale investigation by the Finnish authorities of the prisoner exchange. In the subsequent study by Professor Heikki Ylikangas it turned out that about 2,000 of the exchanged prisoners joined the Russian Liberation Army. The rest, mostly army and political officers, (among them a name-based estimate of 74 Jews), most likely perished in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nDeaths \nMost of the  deaths among Soviet POWs, 16,136, occurred in the ten-month period from December 1941 to September 1942. Prisoners died due to bad camp conditions and the poor supply of food, shelter, clothing, and health care. About a thousand POWs, 5 percent of total fatalities, were shot, primarily in escape attempts. Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest. Punishment for escape attempts or serious violations of camp rules included solitary confinement and execution. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, from 18,318 to 19,085 died  in Finnish prisoner of war camps.\n\nIn 1942 the number of prisoner deaths had a negative effect on Finland's international reputation. The Finnish administration decided to improve living conditions and allowed prisoners to work outside their camps.\n\nHostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union ceased in September 1944, and the first Soviet POWs were handed over to the Soviet Union on 15 October 1944. The transfer was complete by the next month. Some of the POWs escaped during the transportation, and some of them were unwilling to return to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Finland handed over 2,546 German POWs from the Lapland War to the Soviet Union.\n\nTrials in Finland \nAccording to the Moscow Armistice, signed by Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try those who were responsible for the war and those who had committed war crimes. The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals, unlike other losing countries of the Second World War. The Finnish parliament had to create ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union.\n\nCriminal charges were filed against 1,381 Finnish POW camp staff members, resulting in 723 convictions and 658 acquittals. They were accused of 42 murders and 342 other homicides. Nine persons were sentenced to life sentences, 17 to imprisonment for 10\u201315 years, 57 to imprisonment for five to ten years, and 447 to imprisonment varying from one month to five years. Fines or disciplinary corrections were levied out in 124 cases. Although the criminal charges were highly politicized, some war crime charges were filed already during the Continuation War. However, most of them were not processed during wartime.\n\nAftermath\n\nWinter War POWs Returned to the Soviet Union \nAfter the Winter War, the Soviet POWs were returned to the USSR in accordance with the Moscow Peace Treaty. They were transported under heavy guard by the NKVD to special camps as suspected traitors. Prisoners were interrogated by 50 person research teams. After lengthy investigations about 500 of the prisoners were found guilty of high treason and sentenced to death. Some prisoners were released, but most of them, 4,354 men, were sentenced to five to eight years in labour camps (gulag). This would lead to the later death of some of the prisoners due to harsh camp conditions.\n\nContinuation War POWs Returned to the Soviet Union \nAfter the Continuation War, Finland handed over all Soviet and German prisoners of war in accordance with the 10th article of the Moscow Armistice. Furthermore, the article also stipulated the return of all Soviet nationals who were deported to Finland during the Continuation War. This meant that Finland also had to hand over all those who moved to Finland voluntarily, as well as those who fought in the ranks of the Finnish army against the Soviet union, though some had Finnish citizenship. The return to the Soviet Union was in many cases fatal for these people, as some of them were executed as traitors at the Soviet train station at Vyborg and some died in harsh camp conditions in Siberia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the survivors were allowed to return to Finland.\n\nSome of the Soviet prisoners of war co-operated with the Finns during the war. Before the end of the war all related Finnish archives, including interrogation documents relating to co-operating prisoners, were destroyed; and these POWs' destinations after the war are uncertain. Some of them were secretly transported by Finnish army personnel to Sweden and some continued on as far as the United States. The highest ranking Soviet prisoner of war was Major General Vladimir Kirpichnikov, who returned to the Soviet Union. He was tried, convicted of high treason, and executed in 1950.\n\nLegal position of Soviet POWs \nFinland had signed the 1907 Hague IV Convention in 1922 that covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. However, Finland announced that it could not completely obey the convention as the Soviet Union had not signed the same convention. The convention required ratification by both parties to the hostilities before going into effect. Finland did not sign the updated 1929 Third Geneva Convention, because it conflicted with some clauses of Finnish criminal law. Although the Soviet Union had not signed the Hague IV Convention, the reality was unclear and ambiguous. Soviet law specified that a Soviet soldier's surrender constituted treason which was punishable by death or imprisonment and seizure of the soldier's property.\n\nSee also \n Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union\n East Karelian concentration camps\n War children \u00a7 Soviet prisoners of war\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Military history of the Soviet Union during World War II\n*\nCategory:Finland\u2013Soviet Union relations\nCategory:Winter War\nCategory:Continuation War", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

He is a specialist of extinct tubicolous fossils. A microconchid species Microconchus vinni is named in honour of his taxonomic studies of tentaculitoid tubeworms.\n\nBiomineralization studies\nVinn has described majority of annelid skeletal ultrastructures.\nOriented tube structures are present in many serpulid species and cannot\nbe explained by the standard carbonate slurry model. Vinn\nand his co-authors have hypothesized that oriented structures in serpulid tubes have been\nsecreted in the same way as in mollusc shells, based on their ultrastructural similarity.\nVinn and his co-authors proposed alternative ways to explain the calcified secretory\ngranules described by Neff  in the lumen of the calcium-secreting glands in\nserpulids. They proposed that worm actually produces calcium-saturated mucus in the glands. The mucus\nis then deposited on the tube aperture, where crystallization of the structure is\ncontrolled by an organic matrix, as in molluscs.The calcified granules in the glands may only\nbe an artifact of fixation and formed after the death of the worm.\n\nPaleoecology studies\nVinn has studied evolution of symbiosis in several groups of early invertebrates such as cornulitids, microconchids, bryozoans, brachiopods, crinoids, stromatoporoids, tabulates and rugosans. He has described serpulid faunas of Mesozoic to Recent hydrocarbon seeps.

{"text": "News broadcasting\n\nNews broadcasting is the medium of broadcasting of various news events and other information via television, radio, or internet in the field of broadcast journalism. The content is usually either produced locally in a radio studio or television studio newsroom, or by a broadcast network. It may also include additional material such as sports coverage weather forecasts, traffic reports, commentary, and other material that the broadcaster feels is relevant to their audience.\n\nTelevision news\nTelevision news refers to disseminating current events via the medium of television. A \"news bulletin\" or a \"newscast\" are television programs lasting from seconds to hours that provide updates on international, national, regional, and/or local news events.\n\nThere are numerous providers of broadcast news content such as BBC News, NBC News, CNN, Fox News Channel, and Al Jazeera, as well as numerous programs that regularly provide this content such as NBC Nightly News. In addition to general news outlets, there are specialized news outlets, for example about sports ESPNews, Fox Sports News, and Eurosport News, as well as finances, including CNBC, Bloomberg Television, and Fox Business Network.\n\nTelevision news is very visually-based, showing video footage of many of the events that are reported; still photography is also used in reporting news stories, although not as much in recent years as in the early days of broadcast television. Television channels may provide news bulletins as part of a regularly scheduled news program. Less often, television shows may be interrupted or replaced by breaking news reports (\"news flashes\") to provide news updates on events of great importance.\n\nRadio news\nRadio news is similar to television news, but is transmitted through the medium of the radio instead. It is based on the audio aspect rather than the visual aspect. Sound bites are captured through various reporters (generally through audio capture devices such as tape recorders) and played back through the radio. News updates occur more often on radio than on television \u2013 usually about once or twice an hour.\n\nStructure, content, and style\n\nTelevision\nNewscasts, also known as bulletins or news program(me)s, differ in content, tone, and presentation style depending on the format of the channel/station on which they appear, and their timeslot. In most parts of the world, national television networks will have bulletins featuring national and international news. The top-rated shows will often air in the evening during \"prime time\", but there are also  morning newscasts of two to three hours in length. Rolling news channels broadcast news content 24 hours a day. The advent of the internet has allowed the regular 24-hour-a-day presentation of many video and audio news reports, which are updated when additional information becomes available; many television broadcasters provide content originally provided on-air as well as exclusive or supplementary news content on their websites. Local news may be presented by standalone local television stations, stations affiliated with national networks or by local studios which \"opt-out\" of national network programming at specified points. Different news programming may be aimed at different audiences, depending on age, socio-economic group, or those from particular sections of society. \"Magazine-style\" television shows (or newsmagazines) may mix news coverage with topical lifestyle issues, debates, or entertainment content. Public affairs programs provide analysis of and interviews about political, social, and economic issues.\n\nNews programs feature one or two (sometimes, three) anchors (or presenters, the terminology varies depending on the world) segueing into news stories filed by a reporter (or correspondent) by describing the story to be shown; however, some stories within the broadcast are read by the presenter themselves; in the former case, the anchor \"tosses\" to the reporter to introduce the featured story; likewise, the reporter \"tosses\" back to the anchor once the taped report has concluded and the reporter provides additional information. Often in situations necessitating long-form reporting on a story (usually during breaking news situations), the reporter is interviewed by the anchor, known as a 'two-way', or a guest involved in or offering analysis on the story is interviewed by a reporter or anchor. There may also be breaking news stories which will present live rolling coverage.\n\nTelevision news organizations employ several anchors and reporters to provide reports (as many as ten anchors, and up to 20 reporters for local news operations or up to 30 for national news organizations). They may also employ specialty reporters that focus on reporting certain types of news content (such as traffic or entertainment), meteorologists or weather anchors (the latter term often refers to weather presenters that do not have degrees in meteorology earned at an educational institution) who provide weather forecasts \u2013 more common in local news and on network morning programs \u2013 and sports presenters that report on ongoing, concluded, or upcoming sporting events.\n\nPackages will usually be filmed at a relevant location and edited in an editing suite in a newsroom or a remote contribution edit suite in a location some distance from the newsroom. They may also be edited in mobile editing vans, or satellite vans or trucks (such as electronic news gathering vehicles), and transmitted back to the newsroom. Live coverage will be broadcast from a relevant location and sent back to the newsroom via fixed cable links, microwave radio, production truck, satellite truck, or via online streaming. Roles associated with television news include a technical director, floor director audio technician, and a television crew of operators running character graphics (CG), teleprompters, and professional video cameras. Most news shows are broadcast live.\n\nRadio\nRadio news broadcasts can range from as little as one minute to as much as the station's entire schedule, such as the case of all-news radio, or talk radio. Stations dedicated to news or talk content will often feature newscasts, or bulletins, usually at the top of the hour, usually between three and eight minutes in length. They can be a mix of local, regional, national, and international news, as well as sport, entertainment, weather, and traffic reports, or they may be incorporated into separate bulletins. There may also be shorter bulletins at the bottom of the hour, or three at 15-minute intervals, or two at 20-minute intervals. All-news radio stations exist in some countries (most commonly in North America), primarily located in major metropolitan areas such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and Toronto, which often broadcast local, national, and international news and feature stories on a set time schedule (sometimes known as a \"wheel\" format, which schedules the presentation of certain segments focused on a specific type of news content at a specific point each hour).\n\nNews broadcasting by country\n\nCanada\n\nTerrestrial television\nUnlike in the United States, most Canadian television stations have license requirements (enforced by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission) to offer locally produced newscasts (or any local programming, for that matter) in some form. Educational television stations are exempt from these requirements as are multicultural television stations, however some stations licensed as multicultural outlets do produce local newscasts in varied languages (such as the Omni Television station group). Canadian television stations normally broadcast newscasts between two and four times a day: usually at noon; 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00\u00a0p.m. in the evening, and 11:00\u00a0p.m. (there are some variations to this: stations affiliated with CTV usually air their late evening newscasts at 11:30\u00a0p.m., due to the scheduling of the network's national evening news program CTV National News at 11:00\u00a0p.m. in all time zones; most CBC Television-owned stations formerly carried a 10-minute newscast at 10:55\u00a0p.m., following The National, these were expanded to a half-hour and moved to 11:00\u00a0p.m. during the fall of 2012).\n\nSome stations carry morning newscasts (usually starting at 5:30 or 6:00\u00a0a.m., and ending at 9:00\u00a0a.m.). Unlike in the United States, primetime newscasts in the 10:00\u00a0p.m. timeslot are relatively uncommon (three Global owned-and-operated stations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan \u2013 CKND-DT, CFSK-DT, and CFRE-DT \u2013 and Victoria, British Columbia independent station CHEK-DT are the only television stations in the country carrying a primetime newscast); conversely, pre-5:00\u00a0a.m. local newscasts are also uncommon in Canada, Hamilton, Ontario independent station CHCH-DT, whose weekdaily programming consists largely of local news, is currently the only station in the country that starts its weekday morning newscasts before 5:30\u00a0a.m. (the station's morning news block begins at 4:00\u00a0a.m. on weekdays).\n\nLike with U.S. television, many stations use varied titles for their newscasts; this is particularly true with owned-and-operated stations of Global and City (Global's stations use titles based on daypart such as News Hour for the noon and early evening newscasts and News Final for 11:00\u00a0p.m. newscasts, while all six City-owned broadcast stations produce morning news/talk programs under the umbrella title Breakfast Television and its flagship station CITY-DT/Toronto's evening newscasts are titled CityNews). Overall umbrella titles for news programming use the titling schemes \"(Network or system name) News\" for network-owned stations or \"(Callsign) News\" for affiliates not directly owned by a network or television system (although the latter title scheme was used on some network-owned stations prior to the early 2000s).\n\nCBC Television, Global, and CTV each produce national evening newscasts (The National, Global National and CTV National News, respectively), which unlike the American network newscasts do not compete with one another in a common timeslot; while Global National airs at the same early evening time slot as the American evening network newscasts, The Nationals 10:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time slot competes against primetime entertainment programming on the private broadcast networks, while CTV National News airs against locally produced 11:00\u00a0p.m. newscasts on other stations. The National, which has aired on CBC Television since 1954, is the longest-running national network newscast in Canada. All three networks also produce weekly newsmagazines: CBC's The Fifth Estate (aired since 1975), Global's 16x9 (aired since 2008), and CTV's W5 (aired since 1966 and currently the longest-running network newsmagazine in Canada).\n\nCTV's Canada AM, which has aired since 1975, is the sole national morning news program on broadcast television in Canada, although it has since been relegated to semi-national status as most CTV owned-and-operated stations west of the Ontario-Manitoba border dropped the program during the summer and fall of 2011 in favor of locally produced morning newscasts. The Sunday morning talk show is relatively uncommon on Canadian television; for many years, the closest program having similarities to the format was CTV's news and interview series Question Period; Global would eventually debut the political affairs show The West Block in November 2011, which closely follows the format.\n\nCable television\nCanada is host to several 24-hour cable news channels, consisting of domestically-operated cable channels and news channels operated outside Canada or North America. Domestic national news channels include CTV News Channel and Sun News Network, which offer general news programming; Business News Network, which carries business news; and The Weather Network, which offers national and local forecasts. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates two national news networks: the English-language CBC News Network and the French-language R\u00e9seau de l'information (RDI). Other Canadian specialty news channels broadcasting in French include general news networks Argent and Le Canal Nouvelles, and M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia, a French-language sister to The Weather Network.\n\nThe Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission authorizes carriage of some cable channels from foreign countries on domestic cable and satellite operators provided that they are linked to a Canadian network. Amongst news channels, all four major U.S. cable news networks: CNN, HLN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel are available on most providers, along with channels from outside North America such as Al Jazeera English from Qatar, BBC World News from the United Kingdom, Deutsche Welle from Germany, and RT from Russia.\n\nRegionally-based news channels are fairly uncommon in Canada in comparison to the United States. Two 24-hour regional news channels currently exist in the country: the Toronto-centered CP24 and the Vancouver-focused Global News: BC 1 (although CHCH-DT, a general entertainment station with a rolling daytime news block on weekdays (currently from 4:00\u00a0a.m.-4:30\u00a0p.m.) that has existed since August 2009 and hour-long local newscasts nightly at 6:00 and 11:00\u00a0p.m., serves as a de facto regional news channel for Southern Ontario's Golden Horseshoe region); CityNews Channel formerly operated as a competitor to CP24, although that channel shut down after a year-and-a-half of operation in May 2013.\n\nUnited States\n\nBroadcast television\n\nLocal newscasts\nLocal TV stations in the United States normally broadcast local news three to four times a day on average: commonly airing at 4:30, 5:00, 5:30, or 6:00\u00a0a.m.; noon; 5:00 and 6:00\u00a0p.m. in the early evening; and 10:00 or 11:00\u00a0p.m. Some stations carry morning newscasts at 4:00, 7:00, 8:00, or 9:00\u00a0a.m., midday newscasts at 11:00 or 11:30\u00a0a.m., late afternoon newscasts at 4:00 or 4:30\u00a0p.m., or early evening newscasts at 5:30 or 6:30\u00a0p.m. Many Fox affiliates, affiliates of minor networks (such as The CW and MyNetworkTV), and independent stations air newscasts in the final hour of primetime (i.e., 10:00\u00a0p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones or 9:00\u00a0p.m. in the Mountain and Central time zones in the U.S.). Stations that produce local newscasts typically broadcast as little as one to as much over twelve hours of local news on weekdays and as little as one hour to as much as seven hours on weekends; news programming on weekends are typically limited to morning and evening newscasts as the variable scheduling of network sports programming (if a station is affiliated with a network with a sports division) usually prevents most stations from carrying midday newscasts (however a few stations located in the Eastern and Pacific time zones do produce weekend midday newscasts).\n\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, broadcast television stations typically provided local news programs only one to two times each evening for 15 minutes (the normal length for many locally produced programs at the time); usually these programs aired as supplements to network-supplied evening news programs or leadouts for primetime programming. Reports featured on local and national television newscasts during this time were generally provided via film or still photography; eventually, videotape began to be used to provide live coverage of news events. The 1950s also saw the first use of airborne newsgathering; most notably, in 1958, Los Angeles television station KTLA began operating the \"Telecopter\", a helicopter equipped for newsgathering use that was the most advanced airborne television broadcast device of its time.\n\nThe modern-day coverage of major breaking news events came to fruition following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963; the news of Kennedy's death was first announced by Eddie Barker, the news director at KRLD-TV (now KDFW) in Dallas, who passed along word from an official at Parkland Hospital; Barker's scoop appeared live simultaneously on CBS and ABC as a result of a local press pool arrangement. Many local and national news organizations such as Dallas station WFAA-TV and CBS News provided continuous coverage of the events and aftermath for five days. The November 24, 1963 assassination of Kennedy's accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby was fed to NBC by a remote unit on loan to its Dallas affiliate WBAP-TV (now KXAS-TV) from competitor KTVT, and was the first murder to have been witnessed live on U.S. network television. The coverage provided by the local stations eventually led to further investments and technological developments to provide real-time news; newsgathering vehicles equipped with satellites began to be used on the local and national levels beginning in the 1970s. During the 1960s and 1970s, many stations began to provide additional news programming, beginning with midday news programs; in the late 1970s, the first local morning news programs debuted.\n\nAdditional changes in local news content came during the 1980s and 1990s; in January 1989, WSVN in Miami became the first to adopt a news-intensive programming format; rather than fill its schedule with syndicated content as other Fox stations did at the time it joined that network, Ed Ansin (owner of WSVN parent Sunbeam Television) chose instead to heavily invest in the station's news department, and replace national newscasts and late-prime time network programs vacated as a result of losing its NBC affiliation (the byproduct of an affiliation switch caused by CBS and WSVN's former network partner NBC buying other stations in the market) with additional newscasts. This model was eventually replicated by many other stations affiliated with the post-1986 television networks as well as some news-producing independent stations (beginning with Fox's 1994 deals with New World Communications and SF Broadcasting that saw several major network stations change their affiliations), and also resulted in even NBC, CBS, and ABC affiliates adopting similar scheduling formats (tweaked to account for the larger amount of network programming that those networks carry). In 1990, WEWS-TV in Cleveland conceived a concept known as the \"24-Hour News Source\" (which has its origins in a news format used by short-lived Boston independent station WXPO-TV when it signed on in 1969), in which supplementary 30-second long news updates were produced at or near the top of each hour outside regular long-form newscasts during local commercial break inserts shown within network and syndicated programming. The format spread to other U.S. television stations (most notably, WISH-TV in Indianapolis, one of the few remaining users of the concept), most of which eventually disposed of the hourly update format by the early 2000s.\n\nSince the early 1990s, independent stations and stations affiliated with a non-Big Three network have entered into \"news share agreements,\" in which news production is outsourced to a major network station (usually an affiliate of ABC, NBC, or CBS), often to avoid shouldering the cost of starting a news department from scratch or because of a lack of studio space. These commonly involve Fox, CW, and MyNetworkTV affiliates (and previously affiliate stations of the now-defunct predecessors of the latter two networks, The WB and UPN) and in some cases, independent stations; however such agreements exist in certain markets between two co-owned/co-managed Big Three affiliates. News share agreements are most common with stations co-owned with a larger network affiliate or whose operations are jointly managed through a shared service or local marketing agreement. In cases where a station with an existing news department enters into a news share agreement, it will result either the two departments merging or the outright conversion of newscast production from in-house to outsourced production. Minor network affiliates involved in news share agreements will often carry far fewer hours of local newscasts than would be conceivable with an in-house news department to avoid competition with the outsourcing partner's own newscasts, as a result, minor network affiliates involved in these NSAs often will carry a morning newscast from 7:00 to 9:00\u00a0a.m. (in competition with the national network newscasts instead of airing competing with the Big Three affiliates' newscasts) or a primetime newscast at 10:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern and Pacific or 9:00\u00a0p.m. Central and Mountain Time, with limited to no newscasts in other traditional news time periods (midday, late afternoon, or early evening).\n\nBecause of the increased presence of duopolies and outsourcing agreements since the early 2000s, the number of minor network affiliates and independent stations that produce their own newscasts has markedly decreased compared to when duopolies were barred under Federal Communications Commission rules prior to 2000 (as of 2013, there are at least 15 minor network affiliates or independent stations that produce their own local newscasts, most are located within the 20 largest U.S. media markets). Duopolies and outsourcing agreements have also affected Fox stations in a similar manner; although Fox is considered to be a major network on the same level as NBC, ABC, and CBS and has urged its affiliates since the early 1990s to broadcast local news, about half of its stations broadcast local news programming through news share agreements with many of the remainder operating their own news departments. Several stations affiliated with Spanish-language networks (such as Univision and Telemundo) also broadcast their own newscasts, these stations often produce a substantially lower weekly newscast output compared to its English-language counterparts (usually limited to half-hour broadcasts in the evening, and often airing only on weeknights).\n\nUnlike international broadcast stations which tend to brand under uniform newscast titles based solely on network affiliation, U.S. television stations tend to use varying umbrella titles for their newscasts; some title their newscasts utilizing the station's on-air branding (such as combining the network affiliation and channel number with the word \"News\"), others use franchised brand names (like Eyewitness News, Action News and NewsChannel) for their news programming. Conversely, the naming conventions for a station's newscast are sometimes used as a universal on-air branding for the station itself, and may be used for general promotional purposes, even used in promoting syndicated and network programming (such as KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which uses the uniform news and general branding NewsChannel 4). Many stations title their newscasts with catchy names like Daybreak, Good Morning (city or region name), First at Four, Live at Five, Eleven @ 11:00, or Nightcast. These names are intended to set one station apart from the rest, especially for viewers who are chosen for audience measurement surveys. If the respondent was unable to provide a channel number or call letters, the newscast title is often enough for the appropriate station to receive Nielsen ratings credit.\n\nNetwork world news programs\nThe Big Three broadcast television networks produce morning and evening national newscasts. These newscasts are focused on world news, national news, and sometimes local news items that have some national significance. (America This Morning, Good Morning America, and ABC World News are broadcast by ABC, CBS broadcasts the CBS Morning News, CBS This Morning, and the CBS Evening News, and NBC produces Early Today, Today, and NBC Nightly News) as well as weekly newsmagazine series (NBC's Dateline; ABC's 20/20 and Nightline; and CBS's CBS News Sunday Morning, 48 Hours, and 60 Minutes). \n\nNetwork morning newscasts usually air at 7:00\u00a0a.m. (English-language network morning shows air live in the Eastern Time Zone and tape delayed for the remaining time zones, while the Spanish-language morning shows air live in the Eastern, Central, and Mountain time zones and are tape delayed in the Pacific Time Zone); network evening newscasts usually are broadcast live at 6:30\u00a0p.m. on the East Coast and broadcast live in both the Eastern and Central Time Zones, with a secondary live broadcast (otherwise known as a 'Western Edition\") at 6:30\u00a0p.m. Pacific Time. Today was the first morning news program to be broadcast on American television and in the world, when it debuted on January 14, 1952; the earliest national evening news program was The Walter Compton News, a short-lived 15-minute newscast that aired on the DuMont Television Network from 1947 to 1948.\n\nAll four major English networks and the two largest Spanish networks also carry political talk programs on Sunday mornings (NBC's Meet the Press, ABC's This Week, CBS' Face the Nation, Fox's sole news program Fox News Sunday, Univision's Al Punto, and Telemundo's Enfoque); of these programs, Meet the Press holds the distinction of being the longest-running American television program as it has aired since November 6, 1947. The U.S. is one of the few countries in which broadcast networks provide overnight or early morning national news programs, in addition to those airing in the morning and early evening. CBS and ABC are currently the only networks that produce overnight news programs on weeknights in the form of Up to the Minute and World News Now, respectively; NBC previously produced overnight newscasts at different times, both of which have since been cancelled: NBC News Overnight from 1982 to 1983, and NBC Nightside from 1991 to 1998 (NBC currently does not offer a late night newscast, although the network currently airs rebroadcasts of the fourth hour of Today, and sister network CNBC's Mad Money on weeknights).\n\nSpanish-language news programs are provided by Univision, which produces early and late evening editions of its flagship evening news program Noticiero Univision seven nights a week (and was the only nightly newscast on the major Spanish networks until Telemundo resumed its weekend newscasts in October 2014), along with weekday afternoon newsmagazine Primer Impacto and weekday morning program Despierta America); Telemundo, which has a daily flagship evening newscast Noticiero Telemundo, along with weekday morning program Un Nuevo D\u00eda and weekday afternoon newsmagazine Al Rojo Vivo; MundoFox, which produces the weekday-only flagship newscast Noticias MundoFox, along with a weekday afternoon newsmagazine MundoFox \u00a1Y Ya!; Estrella TV, which produces the weekday-only flagship news program Noticiero Estrella TV and the primetime newscast Cierre de Edici\u00f3n; and Azteca Am\u00e9rica, which produces morning, early and late evening newscasts on weekdays under the umbrella title Hechos. In the cases of Univision and Telemundo, both of their evening news programs compete with national evening news programs on their English-language competitors.\n\nFox, The CW, and MyNetworkTV do not produce national morning and evening news programs (although Fox made a brief attempt at a morning program from 1996 to 1997 with Fox After Breakfast; many CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates and independent stations air the syndicated news program The Daily Buzz, while some Tribune Broadcasting-owned CW and MyNetworkTV stations air a similar program called EyeOpener).\n\nCable television\n\n24-hour news channels are devoted to current events around the clock. They are often referred to as cable news channels. The originator of this format from which the name derives is CNN (which following its 1980 launch, spun off other national and international networks using the brand such as CNN International, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and CNN-IBN), originally standing for Cable News Network in reference to the then-new phenomenon of cable television. As satellite and other forms of television have evolved, the term \"cable news\" has become something of an anachronism, but is still in common use; many other television channels have since been established, such as BBC World News, BBC News Channel, Sky News, Al Jazeera, Newsmax TV, ABC News 24, France 24, STAR News, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC. Some news channels specialize even further, such as ESPNews (sports news; sister channel to ESPN); The Weather Channel (weather, although its status as a specialty news channel has become ambiguous due to its recent incorporation of non-news entertainment programming) and WeatherNation (weather); CNBC, Bloomberg Television, and Fox Business Network (financial news).\n\nConversely, several cable news channels exist that carry news reports specifically geared toward a particular metropolitan area, region, or state such as New York City's NY1 (which focuses on the entire New York metropolitan area) and News 12 Networks (which serves portions of the area outside Manhattan), Orlando's News 13 (which is also carried in areas surrounding Greater Orlando), Tampa, Florida's Bay News 9, and Washington, D.C.'s NewsChannel 8. These channels are usually owned by a local cable operator and are distributed solely through cable television and IPTV system operators. Some broadcast television stations also operate cable channels (some of which are repeated through digital multicasting) that air the station's local newscasts in the form of live simulcasts from the television station, with rebroadcasts of the newscasts airing in time periods between the live broadcasts.\n\nA term which has entered common parlance to differentiate cable news from traditional news broadcasts is network news, in reference to the traditional television networks on which such broadcasts air. A classic example is the cable news channel MSNBC, which overlaps with (and, in the case of very significant breaking news events, pre-empts) its network counterpart NBC News; in some cases, viewers may have trouble differentiating between the cable channel and either a counterpart network news organization or a local news operation, such as is the case with Fox News Channel and the Fox network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates (most of which use the Fox (channel #) News brand for their newscasts), due to the network's controversially perceived conservative-leaning political content that differs from the Fox broadcast stations' independent and generally nonpartisan reporting. Most U.S. cable news networks do not air news programming 24 hours a day, often filling late afternoon, primetime, and late night hours with news-based talk programs, documentaries, and other specialty programming.\n\nRadio\n\nMore often, AM radio stations will air a 6\u00bd-minute newscast at the top of the hour, which can be either a local report, a national report from a radio network such as CBS Radio, CNN Radio, NPR, Fox News Radio, or ABC News Radio, or a mix of both local and national content, including weather and traffic reports. Some stations also air a two-minute report at the bottom of the hour.\n\nFM stations, unless they feature a talk radio format, usually only air an abbreviated weather forecast. Some also air minute-long news capsules featuring a quick review of events, and usually only in drive time periods or in critical emergencies, since FM stations usually focus more on playing music. Traffic reports also air on FM stations, depending on the market.\n\nIn some countries, radio news content may be syndicated by a website or company to many stations in a particular region or even the entire country. A notable example is Israel, where there are groups of radio stations that broadcast the same hourly news capsule by an Israeli news website and television station. There are currently two groups of local Israeli stations: one broadcasts news from YNET, the other broadcasts them from Channel 10. Israeli Army Radio general public stations broadcast the same news capsule every hour, and IBA's Kol Israel stations broadcast theirs.\n\nSee also\n\n List of news channels\n Template:Japanese television networks\n Television news music package\n List of news presenters\n United States cable news\n United States television news\n Television news screen layout\nLive streaming world news\n\nFootnotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n Charles L.
